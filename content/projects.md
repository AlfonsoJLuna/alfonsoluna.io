I like to work on personal projects in my free time. Most of them are open-source. Here is a list of the most relevant ones, in different states of completion.

## Electronics

* [openhandheld-mx](https://github.com/AlfonsoJLuna/openhandheld-mx) — An open-source STM32 development board in the shape of a handheld game console.
* [chip8stm32](https://github.com/AlfonsoJLuna/chip8stm32) — STM32 based CHIP-8 and Super-CHIP handheld emulator device.

## Emulation

* [nesswemu](https://github.com/AlfonsoJLuna/nesswemu) — A NES emulator in an early stage of development. Currently only the MOS 6502 interpreter is implemented.
* [chip8swemu](https://github.com/AlfonsoJLuna/chip8swemu) — Multiplatform CHIP-8 and Super-CHIP emulator written in C. Includes a Windows/Linux compatible frontend.

## Others
