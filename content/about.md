Hola! I'm Alfonso. I'm an Electronics Engineer currently living in Murcia, Spain.

I like to develop open-source projects in my free time, this site is the main hub where I write about these projects. Most of them are related to electronics, computers and retro gaming, but you can really expect anything.
