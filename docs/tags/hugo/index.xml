      <description>I have been considering to create a personal website for some time now. The idea is to have a place where I can write about the projects I do in my free time, as well as show them and provide related tutorials and documentation. I think it could be interesting or useful for other people.
Static or dynamic websites After giving a try to more popular options such as Wordpress, I arrived at the conclusion that a static website will be better suited, due to the fact that my needs were simpler.</description>
