      <description>I have been considering to create a personal website for some time now. The idea is to have a place where I can write about the projects I do at my free time, as well as showcase them and provide related tutorials and documentation. I think it could be interesting or helpful for other people.
Static or dynamic websites After giving a try to more popular options such as Wordpress, I arrived to the conclusion that for my simple needs a static website will be better suited.</description>
